## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Heesu, a full-stack developer with experience in Java Spring, React, and Oracle JDBC for database interaction. 

I began my journey in development in 2024, and since then, 
I've found learning web technologies to be both fascinating and rewardingâ€”it broadens my perspective and keeps me engaged.

I love tackling challenges and exploring new technologies, which makes every project an exciting opportunity to grow. 
Seeing my own progress and development through the projects I work on is one of the most fulfilling aspects of being a developer.
